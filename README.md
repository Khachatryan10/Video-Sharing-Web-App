### Video Sharing App documentation

#### Introduction

This is my final project of CS50's Web programming with Python and Javascript and I finally got the opportunity and the knowledge to create a full stack web application on my own.
For this project I used HTML, CSS, Python (Django) including models, and Javascript.
In this Web App you can create an account, login, watch videos, post videos, like and comment them, see your profile with your posted videos, get recommended videos etc.

# Instructions

1. python manage.py makemigrations
2. python manage.py migrate 
3. python manage.py runserver
